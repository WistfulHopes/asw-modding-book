# Mesh/Model

This section is reserved for all mesh mods - anything affecting the actual model of the character. Before embarking on this kind of project, I would recommend having at least minimal experience in [Blender](/tools/blender.md). It's perfectly possible to dive in head-first, however I've found many struggle to get a good product out without first knowing the interface.
If you're instead either bold or foolhardy like I was, read on.

You will need:
- The custom Unreal Engine from [section 1](ue4/getting-unreal.md)
- A copy of Blender (or other modeling software, however Blender is much more widely used among the modding community and so you'll likely find better support for it)
- A copy of UnrealPak from the [pak section](packing/pak-intro.md)

I recommend also using the Blender shader to accurately preview what you're doing from [this youtube playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5Bz_3jZMBw&list=PLCkHUM_E60CSi1HowXR3v4uVWNqUDsl9l&index=7)
